    <h1>Project Showcase</h1>
    <h2>Scratch Projects</h2>
    <p>At the first Inderwick Code club meeting, we made a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/396182222/editor">"Find the person Scratch" Project</a>. The aim of this project was to make a sprite which hides, amongst other sprites and you have to find the right one, within a certain amount of time. </p>
    
    <h2>Trinket Projects</h2>
    <p>The second project that we worked on was a <a href="www.test.com">"Comic strip"</a>. The aim of this was to get an understanding of HTML, and using that to make a little comic.</p>
    
    <h2>Github</h2>
    <p> I use <a href="www.github.com">Github</a> to track my work, host my website and for version control.</p>
